# Overview
This is a real-time solver for 2D transient heat conduction with isothermal boundary conditions in less than 1 Kb of program space. It is intended to be visualized on an LED board with an equivalent number of LEDs in the x and y directory. It was developed by Vector Space as an entry for the 2017, 1Kb Hackaday Challenge.

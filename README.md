# 2D Trainsient Heat Conduction in 1kB
![Conduction Simulation](img/conduction.gif)

## Overview
This is a real-time solver for 2D transient heat conduction with isothermal boundary conditions in less than 1kB of program space. It is intended to be visualized on an LED board with an equivalent number of LEDs in the x and y directory. It was developed by Vector Space as an entry for the 2017, [1kB Hackaday Challenge](https://hackaday.io/contest/18215-the-1kb-challenge).

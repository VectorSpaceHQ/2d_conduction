# Hardware

The hardware consists of:
 * RGB LED matrix made out of 12 individual RGB matrix boards with 64 SK9822 RGB LEDs
 * Arduino Uno
 * Thermistors
 
This directory contains all the files necessary to get the RGB matrix boards manufactured.
Kicad was used to design the board.

The Arduino only uses two wires to interface to all 768 LEDs.
